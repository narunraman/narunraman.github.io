      <description>I pronounce my name like Maroon (with an N) Ramen &amp;ndash; quite an unappetizing sight.1 Having said that, please feel free to email me pictures of oddly colored noodles that you have made or found:

      <description>Mount Rushmore of Restaurants üèî Ratna Cafe (Adyar, Chennai):  My dad&amp;rsquo;s favorite hometown cafe, and for good reason; probably the best sambar in the world, the vada and idli sambar are worth a trip. Their Vada is perfectly cripsy on the outside and packs a ton of flavour inside, be sure to eat it quickly before the sambar makes it too soggy. Weirdly the only thing I could actually keep down when I had amoebic dysentery.</description>
