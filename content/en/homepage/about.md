## a little about me

Hi, I’m Narun Raman! Pronounced like Maroon Ramen (quite an unappetizing sight) with an N. People have interpreted this slightly incorrectly and called me Manun so maybe I should find a new explanation. Please feel free to send me pictures of oddly colored noodles.

I am currently a first year Master's student pursuing Computer Science at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC.

I am very available via email, my basic interests are detailed below and I am interested in working in those areas. Please reach out if you would like to collaborate or chat – I would love to get coffee.
