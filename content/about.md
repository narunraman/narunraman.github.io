## A little about me
{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

Hi, I’m Narun Raman! I pronounce my name like Maroon (with an N) Ramen -- quite an unappetizing sight. Some people have interpreted this slightly incorrectly and called me Manun, so maybe I should find a new explanation. Please feel free to email me pictures of oddly colored noodles that you have made or found: <!-- <span style="color:#dc3545">narunram</span> [at] <span style="color:#dc3545">cs</span> [dot] <span style="color:#dc3545">ubc</span> [dot] <span style="color:#dc3545">ca</span>.   -->
narunram [<span style="color:#dc3545">at</span>] cs [<span style="color:#dc3545">dot</span>] ubc [<span style="color:#dc3545">dot</span>] ca.

I am currently a first year Master's student pursuing Computer Science at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC.

I am very available via email, my basic interests are detailed below and I am interested in working in those areas. Please reach out if you would like to collaborate or chat – I would love to get coffee[^1].
